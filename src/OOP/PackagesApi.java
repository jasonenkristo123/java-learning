package OOP;

// A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory.
// We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:
// Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
// User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
// The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment.
// The library contains components for managing input, database programming, and much much more
// The library is divided into packages and classes. 
// Meaning you can either import a single class (along with its methods and attributes), or a whole package that contain all the classes that belong to the specified package.
// To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import keyword:

// import class contoh nya adalah import java.util.Scanner -> java.util itu package, Scanner adalah class
// import package kalau mau semua package bisa import java.util.*;
public class PackagesApi {
